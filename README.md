# Libft

## Overview
The Libft project is a fundamental and essential project in the 42 curriculum that focuses on creating a custom C library. In this project, students are tasked with implementing a collection of standard library functions from scratch, providing a solid foundation for future programming tasks. This project offers a comprehensive introduction to C programming, memory management, and code organization.

## Description
### Custom C Library
Libft centers around the creation of a custom C library containing various standard library functions. Students will implement functions for tasks like string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list operations, and more. The goal is to provide reusable and efficient functions that can replace or complement the standard C library functions.

### Project Objectives
- Implement a comprehensive set of standard library functions in C.
- Provide efficient and optimized versions of commonly used functions (e.g., string manipulation, memory allocation).
- Organize code into a modular and well-structured library.
- Create a Makefile for easy compilation and use of the library.

## Key Concepts
### C Programming
The Libft project is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of C programming. Students will work extensively with data types, pointers, and memory management in C.

### Memory Management
Memory allocation and management are core concepts in this project. Students will learn to allocate and free memory efficiently, avoiding memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

### Modular Code
Modular code organization is essential for Libft. Students will organize their code into individual functions, each serving a specific purpose and being independently testable.

## Challenges
The Libft project presents several challenges to students:
- Implementing a wide range of standard library functions with efficiency and accuracy.
- Managing memory allocation and deallocation correctly to prevent memory leaks.
- Writing clean and maintainable code with proper documentation.
- Handling edge cases and ensuring robust error handling in library functions.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing the Libft project, students will gain valuable knowledge and experience in the following areas:
- Deepening their understanding of C programming and standard library functions.
- Memory allocation and deallocation techniques in C.
- Code organization and modular programming.
- Documentation and code commenting for maintainable code.
- Debugging and testing for function correctness and performance.
